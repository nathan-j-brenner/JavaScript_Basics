#JavaScript madlibs

##Objective: Create a short blog in an html file without typing any words in html text. Use variables, numbers, strings, arrays, arithmatic operators, concatination, and comments.

If you just completed the Primer Basic, you can add this to your journal repo.

If you're new to this group, you can create a new repository.  Be sure to ask for help if you need some review on this task.

##Goal: By the end of this activity, you should feel comfortable with writing javaScript statements, contatination, data types, and arrays in a script tag of html. 

##Iterations:

1.	Type a couple sentences.
2.	Idenfity parts of the text that could be replaced with a variable.  
3.	Replace text with javaScript elements. 
4.  If all that seemed pretty easy, you've got a couple more options: Look at some code from other students and help them out if they want it. OR, try creating madlib where words from an array are choosen at random.  You'll need a function that will randomly select an element in an array.  Check out the Math library in mdn.
